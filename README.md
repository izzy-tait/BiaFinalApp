Final Project for Mobile App Projects

Hello there!
This is the repository for my final project in my Mobile App Projects class. This app was made using the Android Studio software,
written in Java. This app is intended to help women in abusive relationships by disguising itself as a period tracking app. The app's 
main functionality is to store audio files that are only accessible within the app. The user must press the top right heart icon three 
times rapidly in order to start recording. In order to stop recording, the user must press the same heart icon 11 times rapidly. You must 
be wondering why it's around 11 times to stop it. Remember, this is intended for woman in an abusive relationships. If only one press was 
required to stop recording, how likely would it be for someone in an emotionally unstable state to accidentally press four times instead of
three? The app includes a calendar which uses a SQLite database to store symptoms/moods. The audio files, however, are stored in Firebase 
Storage. A final note, anyone who wants to continue to better this app is absolutely welcome to do so. This app is not yet out in the app 
store, so if you would like to improve upon this app and eventually deploy it to the app store, you are more than welcome to do so as this 
would be helping lots of people out there. 
Thank you!
